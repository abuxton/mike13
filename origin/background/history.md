History
=======

While majestic 12 were chasing not only their tales, but those of the growing number of sightings of alien contacts, at the same time coursing a stir in the civilian populous and keeping the politicians busy feeling pre emptive of a threat from beyond the stars. The shadows surrounding all partys were still moving against humanity. 
Mike 13 were never validated in the same way, Majestic 13 as the department is actually know had been in the shadows defending humanity against the other thing that dwell in the shadows. Those creatures that have made it into folk law, been used countless times to send children scurying behind the sofa and to their beds. 

Image over the years how many battle hardened soldiers have fallen to their knees when faced by impossible creatures from their own childhood nightmares, things that sent them cringing into their beds hiding from the shadows,. Imagine what repressed feelings were brought to the fore when facing a creature such as that. Imagine when your faith is challenged not just your faith in religion, but in what you know, what you belive on every level. When bullets don't stop the approaching shadow, they barely hold them back. When what you see challenges on every level your faith in what ever diety you believe, or just has disturbingly proves maybe after death their is something more. What do you do when your protective bastian of science, proof and evidance are challanged or used against you.

Majestic 13 were never formalised, nore were the formally called together. The organisation grew out of the ever growing responses to occult and supernaturel activity. Informally a counter group in WWI to Hitlers attempt at gathering the occult. Given more resources and being forced into taking direct action as a responce to Project Ragnarok yet still not validated.

Mike 13 was the call sign taken on to allow those involved to at least recognise one an other, and to ease communication within other organisations they were drawn or more like dragged in from.

With the formal creation of Majestic 12, the monica Majestic 13 was loosely tagged on the growing shadow organisation. There finances were actually syphoned off of the formal organisation while there was some cross over in the command structure.  Even with this cross over, the number of people actually tagged to M13 never grew above double figures, agents and forces were informally drafted in as they encountered the threats to them, the command of M13 gathering data and interceding were they realised threat and oportunity.
