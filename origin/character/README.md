Character creation
=========================

Character creation rules, and extrenious information

Character concepts:
I have this crazy first thought, what if instead of every body having a character everybody had characters, maybe the same one maybe vastly different, alternate time versiosn of their character with scaled progression.

What if events where not linear, what if events were broken down to scenerios. Players bringing characters to match those scenarios, or they progressed and regresse da set character appropriatly based on scenario setting?

imagine being the various stages of Bourne in various scenarios.
