Mj13
====

This is not you normal use of GIT.

mj13 - Majestic 13, 'Nobody sees into the shadows, they choose to look into the light, and while distracted by the light they miss what hides in those shadows. We don't' - unnamed Delta operative 

MJ13 is an idea, encompassing inspiration from Cthulhu mythos and Delta Green, modern airsoft and Live Action Role Play.

N.B.
The fact you find this in git is my extension for tools I work with.
The site will be produced in a mix of markdown to facilitate showoff presentation and pdf printing, and valdid html to facilitate it being served from web technologies under abuxton.github.io/mj13/
